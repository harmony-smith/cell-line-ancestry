# cell-line-ancestry
A rudimentary program to determine the possible ancestries of cell lines from a database.

There is a database refence file (.csv) and a query reference file (.csv). Using the query reference file, multiple queries can be submitted at once.
The program will write possible ancestries to a results file that will show the combinations.
